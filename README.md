# Give-Us-This-Day-Our-Daily-Hack
A repository for solving common DSA interview-style problems every day!

To use this repository:

  1. Make a copy
  2. Create a new branch
  3. Solve the algo
  4. Push the solution to your newly created branch!

The idea is to keep those green little boxes on your GitHub profile happy while also increasing your DSA knowledge. It's a win-win!

I've just created this repository and will be adding new problems to it each day. If you have any good ones you'd like to include, request a PR and I'll probably approve it
