# Give-Us-This-Day-Our-Daily-Hack

A repository for solving common JavaScript DSA interview-style problems every day!

To use this repository:

1. Make a copy
2. Create a new branch
3. Set your new branch as the main branch (to get those precious green boxes)
4. Solve the algo
5. Push the solution to your newly created branch!

The idea is to keep those green little boxes on your GitHub profile happy while also increasing your DSA knowledge. It's a win-win!

I'll be adding new problems to it occasionally; if you have any good ones you'd like to include, request a PR and I'll probably approve it
