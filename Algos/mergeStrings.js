/*
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in 
alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, 
append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
